Everyone said impossible. With David Canas as processor, Chris Barnes and Susan Phifer the impossible did not exist. I have dealt with banks all my career as a CPA and CFO and Consumer Direct put them all to shame. Their responsiveness and understanding of each and every situation was professional, expedient and in my experience amazing. Every realtor I spoke to badmouthed an \"internet\" bank and they are all now eating crow. I chose Consumer Direct because of their competitive rates, but no bank is as competitive with  the  people that work at Consumer Direct. \\r\\n   \n",

We shopped around for the best available rate and luckily found this company. We had the pleasure of working with Tim Williams. It was our first time doing a refinance and Tim did an absolute good job explaining in detail the refinance process, being always available and answering every single question my wife and I had. In all, the whole refinance process was made easy, Tim delivered on his promises and we couId not be more satisfied. Tim and OFM were very professional, prompt and most importantly, honest. I would highly recommend Optimum First Mortgage to anyone.   \n",

They never indicated any problems, and were always courteous and professional.  Any questions I had were answered over the phone or emailed.  However, I was asked to sign the same documents online and then on hard copies sent overnight, and then again upon closing.  I also received several emails that were computer-generated telling me my refinance was \"conditionally approved\" depending on  In spite of their claims that they are self-funded, my loan was held up by requests for further documentation from their underwriters (e.g. two phone calls and an email to verify my employment--already indicated by W-2s and tax returns).  In the end, my refinance, which I was told would take about 30 days, took over 100 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot recommend eRates.   \n",

Everyone said impossible. With David Canas as processor, Chris Barnes and Susan Phifer the impossible did not exist. I have dealt with banks all my career as a CPA and CFO and Consumer Direct put them all to shame. Their responsiveness and understanding of each and every situation was professional, expedient and in my experience amazing. Every realtor I spoke to badmouthed an \"internet\" bank and they are all now eating crow. I chose Consumer Direct because of their competitive rates, but no bank is as competitive with  the  people that work at Consumer Direct. \\r\\n   \n",

The online process was very smooth and quick, and my loan closed within 30 days at a great rate.  Never again will we use a dinosaur lender that drags their heels and makes you do all the work.  This was the most seamless loan process we have ever been through.  Thanks Dan. Such excellence!   \n",

Not only was it convenient and clear as to what and how to submit documentation, but the loan specialists were readily available to answer questions: every phone call was answered the first time, any voice mails and emails were promptly answered.  The mortgage is in my spouse's name, yet they took my calls, answered my concerns and questions.  A really great and efficient experience.   \n",

       "40  These guys are probably fine for a standard mortgage, but for anything more technical they might fumble the ball. What is worse is that if they do mess things up they won't take responsibility to make it right. I wanted to refinance our house and they had a great rate. After approval, they very nicely said it turned out that I didn't have to have an appraisal done, and we were set to close by the end of the year. We were set to close on Friday, December 29. On Wednesday, December 27, less than 48 hours before closing, they called and said they were wrong, we did need an appraisal. I'm not mad about needing it, that's expected, but they offered to forego it, and then didn't catch the error until it was too late. So that cost $425 more than I thought on Wednesday, but that was fair. The delay of having to schedule the appraisal and get it back though meant I had to make another month of interest payments on other debt that would've already been paid off if we had closed on time.

The other loan officers ( not from best rate) were\\nawful at returning calls or emails. Ray however picked up his phone literally 90% of the time and if he didn't it would be within the hour I would get a call back.

Jennifer Chang was referred to me by a coworker and I couldn't be happier. I've had such bad experiences shopping around for my refi with all the lenders playing games and wanting too much personal information before providing a simple quote. Jennifer was very straightforward with what she could offer without asking for a ton of information. No games, no hassle, zero pressure, and I'm so glad she was able to provide the lowest rates. Complete honesty and transparency throughout the whole process - she had immediate responses to any questions I had, but she was never pushy or tried to \"sell\" me anything. Jennifer seems to really care about her clients and puts them first. Best customer service I have ever had.    \n",

There were a few hurdles to get over but nothing Abe couldn't handle. Abe kept me informed and explained what i didn't  understand which was allot. He called me every time things changed and walked  me through the way i could understand. This is my first home and had never refinanced before.He was always willing to help and i never doubted he would get the job done. Anyone i know who is in the market to buy or sell a home i will recommend Abe Davis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely, Sandra L Morgan   \n",

They tried to schedule the appraisal before the inspection was back. I didn’t want to pay for an appraisal if something was found on the already paid for inspection that would make me back out. Then they forgot to reschedule my appraisal! It delayed closing 3 times. They were also not in sync with my realtor. Great FHA lender but watch like a hawk because Quicken moves too fast and misses the mark. Be in control of your purchase or you may regret it!    \n",

We worked with Jennifer Chang, she was efficient, communicative, proactive, respectful and thorough.  A mortgage broker doesn't get better.  At one point the manager helped out, Mike Greenberg, his expertise finalized our loan.  Completely happy and satisfied!  Thank you Jennifer - you are our go-to from here on out!     \n",

Numbers didn't fall exactly where we thought they would but still worked out very good and were able to accomplish most of our goals. Would and havw recommended them to family and friends when need to buy or refinance.   \n",

I only researched refinance rates but ended up getting BOMBARDED with phone calls from everyone near and far in the hopes they would be the ones to get my business.  I would get anywhere from 26 - 12 calls every single day!!!!!  It was so stressful I ended up not answering my phone.  Ultimately, Danesha reached out via e-mail and made contact with me.  After earning my trust I called her.  Thankful I did - she made a stressful situation an easy process that, in the long run, was a great move.  Thank you Danesha - if I ever need mortgage services again, I would use you and highly recommend you.     \n",

He has helped me refi my old home and most recently, he helped me with a new home purchase. To describe my experience with Jeff so far, in short, he is a great guy. He is incredibly pleasant to work with, very professional, and highly accessible. He keeps a process muddled in crazy amounts of paperwork very well organized and he worked hard to make sure that every one of my numerous questions were answered and he let me know about what was happening throughout the entire loan process. Plus, he has secured great rates for me on both my refi and new home purchase so that's nice too... I cannot recommend him highly enough!   \n",

I looked online and found that BestRateUSA.com had the lowest rates I could find. . . I called and talked with Sharyn. She discoused my options and gave me her professional opinion. I told Sharyn I would be talking with my prior refi company, Discover Home Lending, prior to committing to her . They couldn't match Sharyn's offer and tried to convince me that there were hidden catches and fees. After talking with Sharyn about those concerns, she convinced me that BestRateUSA.com was above the board and she would be there through the entire process. I said lets do it! ! ! I filled out the online application , locked my rate, began uploading my documents, and 2 weeks later I signed my new loan documents. . . My refi was done! . . . Thanks Sharyn and BestRate.com for everything. . . A++++++++   \n",
